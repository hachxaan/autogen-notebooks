# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Group Chat with GPTAssistantAgent

AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.
Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to get multiple `GPTAssistantAgent` converse through group chat.

## Requirements

AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install:
```bash
pip install "pyautogen==0.2.0b5"
```

## Set your API Endpoint

The [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json) function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or a json file.


```python
import autogen

config_list_gpt4 = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4", "gpt-4-1106-preview", "gpt-4-32k"],
    },
)
```

It first looks for environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" which needs to be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for a json file named "OAI_CONFIG_LIST". It filters the configs by models (you can filter by other keys as well).

The config list looks like the following:
```python
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "api_key": "<your OpenAI API key>",
    },  # OpenAI API endpoint for gpt-4
]
```

Currently Azure OpenAI does not support assistant api. You can set the value of config_list in any way you prefer. Please refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/oai_openai_utils.ipynb) for full code examples of the different methods.

## Define GPTAssistantAgent and GroupChat


```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.gpt_assistant_agent import GPTAssistantAgent
from autogen.agentchat import AssistantAgent

# Define user proxy agent
llm_config = {"config_list": config_list_gpt4, "cache_seed": 45}
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
   name="User_proxy",
   system_message="A human admin.",
   code_execution_config={"last_n_messages": 2, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
   human_input_mode="TERMINATE"
)

# define two GPTAssistants
coder = GPTAssistantAgent(
    name="Coder",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list_gpt4,
    },
    instructions=AssistantAgent.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE
)

analyst = GPTAssistantAgent(
    name="Data_analyst",
    instructions="You are a data analyst that offers insight into data.",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list_gpt4,
    },
)
# define group chat
groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, coder, analyst], messages=[], max_round=10)
manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)
```

    assistant_id was None, creating a new assistant
    assistant_id was None, creating a new assistant


## Initiate Group Chat
Now all is set, we can initiate group chat.


```python
user_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message="Get the number of issues and pull requests for the repository 'microsoft/autogen' over the past three weeks and offer analysis to the data. You should print the data in csv format grouped by weeks.")
# type exit to terminate the chat
```

    [33mUser_proxy[0m (to chat_manager):
    
    Get the number of issues and pull requests for the repository 'microsoft/autogen' over the past three weeks and offer analyzes to the data. You should print the data in csv format grouped by weeks.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mCoder[0m (to chat_manager):
    
    To gather the number of issues and pull requests for the repository 'microsoft/autogen' over the past three weeks and to offer an analysis of the data, we'll need to modify the previous script.
    
    We will enhance the script to gather data from the past three weeks, separated by each week, and then output the data in CSV format, grouped by the week during which the issues and pull requests were created. This will require us to make multiple API calls for each week and aggregate the data accordingly.
    
    I will provide you a python script to execute.
    
    ```python
    # filename: github_data_weekly_analyzer.py

            created_at = datetime.strptime(item['created_at'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
            week = created_at.strftime('%U')

                issues = [issue for issue in issues if 'pull_request' not in issue]
    
                # Count issues and pull requests by week
                issue_counts = count_items_by_week(issues)
                pull_request_counts = count_items_by_week(pull_requests)
    
                # Aggregate csv data
                for week in issue_counts:

    # Run the analyze function
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        analyze_data()
    ```
    
    Please save this code as `github_data_weekly_analyzer.py` and run it. The script will output the number of issues and pull requests for the repository 'microsoft/autogen' over the past three weeks, grouped by week in CSV format.
    
    If there are any issues or errors during the execution of this script, please let me know the exact error message, and I will assist you in resolving it.

    The script executed successfully and provided the following data output in CSV format for the past three weeks:
    
    ```
    week,issue_count,pull_request_count
    46,11,10
    45,40,30
    44,9,26
    ```
    
    Week numbers are based on the `%U` directive of `strftime`, which considers week 00 as the first week of the year with a Sunday in it.
    
    Here's the analysis by week:
    
    - Week 46: There were 11 issues and 10 pull requests. This suggests a balanced amount of reported issues and new code contributions. The relatively close numbers might indicate that the repository sees simultaneous reporting of issues and active development.
      
    - Week 45: This week shows significantly more activity than the other two, with 40 issues and 30 pull requests being recorded. This could be a result of a coordinated milestone or sprint ending, where a large set of changes were made, and corresponding issues either surfaced or were also worked on.
      
    - Week 44: The activity dropped to 9 issues and 26 pull requests. While the number of issues decreased, the number of pull requests remained substantial. This may imply a continuation of effort to address the issues raised in the busier previous week or ongoing development work.
    
    The overall impression over the past three weeks is that the `microsoft/autogen` repository is actively maintained and developed, with varying levels of activity that could be associated with the development cycle or external events impacting the project.
    
    Please note that the numbers may be overlapping because the GitHub API will include issues and pull requests updated within the date range, which could increase the count if the items are updated but not necessarily created within that range.
    
    It's also important to consider that the collected data might not fully represent what happened in each week if there are items created before Week 44 that were updated during the weeks considered. For a more accurate approach, we would need to consider only issues and pull requests created within each week specifically, which would require additional filtering based on the `created_at` attribute.
    
    If more in-depth analysis or longer trends are needed, additional data over a more extended period would be recommended, along with information about the nature of the issues and pull requests (e.g., what kind of issues are most common, how quickly they're closed, how often pull requests are merged, etc.).
