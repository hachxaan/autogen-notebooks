# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Group Chat with Coder and Visualization Critic

AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.
Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

## Requirements

AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install:
```bash
pip install pyautogen
```


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
# %pip install pyautogen~=0.2.0b4
```

## Set your API Endpoint

The [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json) function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or a json file.


```python
import autogen

config_list_gpt4 = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4", "gpt-4-0314", "gpt4", "gpt-4-32k", "gpt-4-32k-0314", "gpt-4-32k-v0314"],
    },
)
# config_list_gpt35 = autogen.config_list_from_json(
#     "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
#     filter_dict={
#         "model": {
#             "gpt-3.5-turbo",
#             "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
#             "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
#             "chatgpt-35-turbo-0301",
#             "gpt-35-turbo-v0301",
#         },
#     },
# )
```

It first looks for environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" which needs to be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for a json file named "OAI_CONFIG_LIST". It filters the configs by models (you can filter by other keys as well). Only the gpt-4 models are kept in the list based on the filter condition.

The config list looks like the following:
```python
config_list = [
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2023-08-01-preview',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4-32k',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2023-08-01-preview',
    },
]
```

You can set the value of config_list in any way you prefer. Please refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/oai_openai_utils.ipynb) for full code examples of the different methods.

You are a helpful assistant highly skilled in evaluating the quality of a given visualization code by providing a score from 1 (bad) - 10 (good) while providing clear rationale. YOU MUST CONSIDER VISUALIZATION BEST PRACTICES for each evaluation. Specifically, you can carefully evaluate the code across the following dimensions
- bugs (bugs):  are there bugs, logic errors, syntax error or typos? Are there any reasons why the code may fail to compile? How should it be fixed? If ANY bug exists, the bug score MUST be less than 5.
- Data transformation (transformation): Is the data transformed appropriately for the visualization type? E.g., is the dataset appropriated filtered, aggregated, or grouped  if needed? If a date field is used, is the date field first converted to a date object etc?
- Goal compliance (compliance): how well the code meets the specified visualization goals?
- Visualization type (type): CONSIDERING BEST PRACTICES, is the visualization type appropriate for the data and intent? Is there a visualization type that would be more effective in conveying insights? If a different visualization type is more appropriate, the score MUST BE LESS THAN 5.
- Data encoding (encoding): Is the data encoded appropriately for the visualization type?
- aesthetics (aesthetics): Are the aesthetics of the visualization appropriate for the visualization type and the data?

YOU MUST PROVIDE A SCORE for each of the above dimensions.
{bugs: 0, transformation: 0, compliance: 0, type: 0, encoding: 0, aesthetics: 0}
Do not suggest code. 
Finally, based on the critique above, suggest a concrete list of actions that the coder should take to improve the code.

## Start Chat


```python

    download data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwdata/draco/master/data/cars.csv and plot a visualization that tells us about the relationship between weight and horsepower. Save the plot to a file. Print the fields in a dataset before visualizing it.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mCoder[0m (to chat_manager):
    
    First, let's download the data and print its fields:
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    
    # Download the data
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwdata/draco/master/data/cars.csv"
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    
    # Print the fields in the dataset
    print(df.columns)
    
    # Prepare the plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='Weight_in_lbs', y='Horsepower')
    
    # Save the plot to a file
    plt.savefig('weight_vs_horsepower.png')
    
    # Show the plot
    plt.show()
    ```
    
    This script will download the data from the provided URL, print the fields in the dataset, and create a scatter plot of the relationship between weight and horsepower. It will then save the plot to a file named "weight_vs_horsepower.png" and display the plot.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mCritic[0m (to chat_manager):
    
    I have reviewed your code and here's the evaluation based on the specified dimensions:
    
    - bugs (bugs): 10/10; There are no bugs, logic errors, syntax errors, or typos I can identify.
    - Data transformation (transformation): 10/10; There is no need for data transformation in this case, as the data can be directly plotted with the desired variables for a scatter plot.
    - Goal compliance (compliance): 10/10; The code properly downloads the dataset, prints the fields, and creates a visualization for the relationship between weight and horsepower. Finally, it saves the plot to a file.
    - Visualization type (type): 10/10; Scatter plot is an appropriate visualization type for depicting the relationship between weight and horsepower, which are both continuous variables.
    - Data encoding (encoding): 10/10; The code properly encodes the variables in the x and y axes using the 'Weight_in_lbs' and 'Horsepower' columns from the dataset.
    - aesthetics (aesthetics): 10/10; The aesthetics of the plot are appropriate. By default, the seaborn scatter plot provides a clean and modern look.
    
    To improve the code:
    
    1. Notice that there are no identified issues or suggestions for improvement, as the code is concise and properly meets the specified visualization goals.

    I'm glad the updated code worked. Here's the updated evaluation based on the specified dimensions:
    
    - bugs (bugs): 10/10; The column name issue is now resolved, and there are no bugs, logic errors, syntax errors, or typos.
    - Data transformation (transformation): 10/10; As before, there is no need for data transformation in this case.
    - Goal compliance (compliance): 10/10; The updated code properly downloads the correct dataset, prints the fields and the first few rows, creates a visualization of the relationship between weight and horsepower, saves the plot to a file, and displays the plot.
    - Visualization type (type): 10/10; A scatter plot remains an appropriate visualization type for depicting the relationship between weight and horsepower.
    - Data encoding (encoding): 10/10; With the corrected column names, the code now properly encodes the variables in the x and y axes using the 'Weight_in_lbs' and 'Horsepower' columns.
    - aesthetics (aesthetics): 10/10; The aesthetics of the plot are appropriate, as the seaborn scatter plot provides a clean and modern look.
    
    To improve the code:
    
    1. No further improvements are needed as the updated code works correctly and meets the specified visualization goals.

    I will first download the data and print the fields of the dataset. Then, I'll create a plot and save it to a file. Please execute the following Python code to download the data, print the fields, and generate the weather plot.
    
    ```python
    # filename: weather_plot.py
    
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/main/docs/data/seattle-weather.csv"
    data = pd.read_csv(url)
    print("Fields in the dataset:")
    print(data.columns)
    
    # Count the occurrences of each weather type
    weather_counts = data['weather'].value_counts()
    
    # Create a bar plot of weather occurrences
    sns.set(style='whitegrid', font_scale=1.2)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    weather_plot = sns.barplot(x=weather_counts.index, y=weather_counts.values)
    
    # Add labels and title
    weather_plot.set(xlabel='Weather Types', ylabel='Number of Days', title='Seattle Weather Types Frequency')
    plt.savefig('weather_plot.png')
    
    print("Plot has been saved to 'weather_plot.png'.")
    ```
    
    Run this script by executing the command `python weather_plot.py`. This will output the weather dataset's fields and create a plot named 'weather_plot.png' in your current directory.
    
    After running the code, let me know any improvement that the critic suggests in the code.

    Based on the provided code, here is my critique:
    
    - bugs: 10/10 - The code is clean, and I didn't find any syntax errors, logic errors, or bugs in it.
    - transformation: 9/10 - The data is being transformed appropriately. The count of each weather type is calculated from the dataset. However, there is a minor issue: The raw data should have been preprocessed to handle possible null or unexpected values.
    - compliance: 10/10 - The code meets the specified visualization goals. It downloads the data, prints the fields, and saves the plot to a file.
    - type: 10/10 - The bar plot is an appropriate visualization type for showing the count of each weather type, and it effectively conveys the required insight.
    - encoding: 10/10 - The encoding is appropriate; the x-axis represents weather types, and the y-axis represents the number of days, as required.
    - aesthetics: 9/10 - The aesthetics used are appropriate, but the plot would benefit from the addition of a color palette that reflects the meaning of the data.
    
    To improve the code, the coder should:
    1. Load and preprocess the raw data to handle possible null or unexpected values.
    2. Apply a meaningful color palette to the bar plot to enhance the visual appearance.

    Thank you for the feedback. Based on the critique, I will address the suggestions and improve the code. I will preprocess the raw data to handle possible null or unexpected values and use a meaningful color palette for the bar plot.
    
    Please execute the updated Python code below.
    
    ```python
    # filename: improved_weather_plot.py

    # Preprocess raw data: remove null or unexpected values
    data = data.dropna()
    data = data[data['weather'].isin(['sun', 'fog', 'drizzle', 'rain', 'snow'])]
    
    print("Fields in the dataset:")
    print(data.columns)
    
    # Count the occurrences of each weather type
    weather_counts = data['weather'].value_counts()
    
    # Create a bar plot of weather occurrences
    weather_palette = {'sun': 'yellow', 'fog': 'gray', 'drizzle': 'lightblue', 'rain': 'blue', 'snow': 'white'}
    sns.set(style='whitegrid', font_scale=1.2)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    weather_plot = sns.barplot(x=weather_counts.index, y=weather_counts.values, palette=weather_palette)
    
    # Add labels and title
    weather_plot.set(xlabel='Weather Types', ylabel='Number of Days', title='Seattle Weather Types Frequency')
    plt.savefig('improved_weather_plot.png')
    
    print("Improved plot has been saved to 'improved_weather_plot.png'.")
    ```
    
    Run this script by executing the command `python improved_weather_plot.py`. This will output the dataset's fields, preprocess the data, and create an improved plot named 'improved_weather_plot.png' in your current directory.
