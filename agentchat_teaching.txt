# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching

AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework makes it easy to build many advanced applications of LLMs.
Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

This notebook demonstrates how AutoGen enables a user to teach AI new skills via natural agent interactions, without requiring knowledge of programming language. It is modified based on https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/evaluation/notebook/research_paper/teaching.ipynb and https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/evaluation/notebook/research_paper/teaching_recipe_reuse.ipynb.

## Requirements

AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install:
```bash
pip install "pyautogen~=0.2.0b5"
```


```python
# %pip install --quiet "pyautogen~=0.2.0b5"
```

## Set your API Endpoint

The [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json) function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or a json file.

It first looks for environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" which needs to be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for a json file named "OAI_CONFIG_LIST". It filters the configs by models (you can filter by other keys as well).

The json looks like the following:
```json
[
    {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "api_key": "<your OpenAI API key here>"
    },
    {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "api_key": "<your Azure OpenAI API key here>",
        "base_url": "<your Azure OpenAI API base here>",
        "api_type": "azure",
        "api_version": "2023-06-01-preview"
    },
    {
        "model": "gpt-4-32k",
        "api_key": "<your Azure OpenAI API key here>",
        "base_url": "<your Azure OpenAI API base here>",
        "api_type": "azure",
        "api_version": "2023-06-01-preview"
    }
]
```

```

## Example Task: Literature Survey

We consider a scenario where one needs to find research papers of a certain topic, categorize the application domains, and plot a bar chart of the number of papers in each domain.

### Construct Agents

We create an assistant agent to solve tasks with coding and language skills. We create a user proxy agent to describe tasks and execute the code suggested by the assistant agent.


```python
# create an AssistantAgent instance named "assistant"
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: True if "TERMINATE" in x.get("content") else False,
)
# create a UserProxyAgent instance named "user_proxy"
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: True if "TERMINATE" in x.get("content") else False,
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "work_dir",
        "use_docker": False,
    },
)
```

    1. Who Should I Trust: AI or Myself? Leveraging Human and AI Correctness
      Likelihood to Promote Appropriate Trust in AI-Assisted Decision-Making
    Abstract: In AI-assisted decision-making, it is critical for human decision-makers to
    know when to trust AI and when to trust themselves. However, prior studies
    calibrated human trust only based on AI confidence indicating AI's correctness
    likelihood (CL) but ignored humans' CL, hindering optimal team decision-making.
    To mitigate this gap, we proposed to promote humans' appropriate trust based on
    the CL of both sides at a task-instance level. We first modeled humans' CL by
    approximating their decision-making models and computing their potential
    performance in similar instances. We demonstrated the feasibility and
    effectiveness of our model via two preliminary studies. Then, we proposed three
    CL exploitation strategies to calibrate users' trust explicitly/implicitly in
    the AI-assisted decision-making process. Results from a between-subjects
    experiment (N=293) showed that our CL exploitation strategies promoted more
    appropriate human trust in AI, compared with only using AI confidence. We
    further provided practical implications for more human-compatible AI-assisted
    decision-making.
    
    2. Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration
      in AI-Assisted Decision Making
    Abstract: Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in
    high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often
    undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because
    human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's
    to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision
    making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to
    optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately
    \textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when
    to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply
    their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely
    to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision
    making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores
    whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate
    trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we
    study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a
    particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence
    score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration
    alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also
    depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement
    the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for
    AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to
    explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.
    
    3. Trust Explanations to Do What They Say
    Abstract: How much are we to trust a decision made by an AI algorithm? Trusting an
    algorithm without cause may lead to abuse, and mistrusting it may similarly
    lead to disuse. Trust in an AI is only desirable if it is warranted; thus,
    calibrating trust is critical to ensuring appropriate use. In the name of
    calibrating trust appropriately, AI developers should provide contracts
    specifying use cases in which an algorithm can and cannot be trusted. Automated
    explanation of AI outputs is often touted as a method by which trust can be
    built in the algorithm. However, automated explanations arise from algorithms
    themselves, so trust in these explanations is similarly only desirable if it is
    warranted. Developers of algorithms explaining AI outputs (xAI algorithms)
    should provide similar contracts, which should specify use cases in which an
    explanation can and cannot be trusted.
    
    4. A Systematic Literature Review of User Trust in AI-Enabled Systems: An
      HCI Perspective
    Abstract: User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been
    increasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It
    has been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric
    approaches and towards embracing a more human centric approach, a core
    principle of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. This review aims to
    provide an overview of the user trust definitions, influencing factors, and
    measurement methods from 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future
    technical and design strategies, research, and initiatives to calibrate the
    user AI relationship. The findings confirm that there is more than one way to
    define trust. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user
    trust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing
    definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by
    three main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design
    features, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings,
    reinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to
    monitoring of AI enabled systems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be
    addressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or
    discussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship requires finding
    the optimal balance that works for not only the user but also the system.
    
    5. Trust Calibration and Trust Respect: A Method for Building Team Cohesion
      in Human Robot Teams
    Abstract: Recent advances in the areas of human-robot interaction (HRI) and robot
    autonomy are changing the world. Today robots are used in a variety of
    applications. People and robots work together in human autonomous teams (HATs)
    to accomplish tasks that, separately, cannot be easily accomplished. Trust
    between robots and humans in HATs is vital to task completion and effective
    team cohesion. For optimal performance and safety of human operators in HRI,
    human trust should be adjusted to the actual performance and reliability of the
    robotic system. The cost of poor trust calibration in HRI, is at a minimum, low
    performance, and at higher levels it causes human injury or critical task
    failures. While the role of trust calibration is vital to team cohesion it is
    also important for a robot to be able to assess whether or not a human is
    exhibiting signs of mistrust due to some other factor such as anger,
    distraction or frustration. In these situations the robot chooses not to
    calibrate trust, instead the robot chooses to respect trust. The decision to
    respect trust is determined by the robots knowledge of whether or not a human
    should trust the robot based on its actions(successes and failures) and its
    feedback to the human. We show that the feedback in the form of trust
    calibration cues(TCCs) can effectively change the trust level in humans. This
    information is potentially useful in aiding a robot it its decision to respect
    trust.
    
    6. Trust Considerations for Explainable Robots: A Human Factors Perspective
    Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have drawn
    attention to the need for AI systems and robots to be understandable to human
    users. The explainable AI (XAI) and explainable robots literature aims to
    enhance human understanding and human-robot team performance by providing users
    with necessary information about AI and robot behavior. Simultaneously, the
    human factors literature has long addressed important considerations that
    contribute to human performance, including human trust in autonomous systems.
    In this paper, drawing from the human factors literature, we discuss three
    important trust-related considerations for the design of explainable robot
    systems: the bases of trust, trust calibration, and trust specificity. We
    further detail existing and potential metrics for assessing trust in robotic
    systems based on explanations provided by explainable robots.
    
    7. Experimental Investigation of Trust in Anthropomorphic Agents as Task
      Partners
    Abstract: This study investigated whether human trust in a social robot with
    anthropomorphic physicality is similar to that in an AI agent or in a human in
    order to clarify how anthropomorphic physicality influences human trust in an
    agent. We conducted an online experiment using two types of cognitive tasks,
    calculation and emotion recognition tasks, where participants answered after
    referring to the answers of an AI agent, a human, or a social robot. During the
    experiment, the participants rated their trust levels in their partners. As a
    result, trust in the social robot was basically neither similar to that in the
    AI agent nor in the human and instead settled between them. The results showed
    a possibility that manipulating anthropomorphic features would help assist
    human users in appropriately calibrating trust in an agent.
    
    8. Uncalibrated Models Can Improve Human-AI Collaboration
    Abstract: In many practical applications of AI, an AI model is used as a decision aid
    for human users. The AI provides advice that a human (sometimes) incorporates
    into their decision-making process. The AI advice is often presented with some
    measure of "confidence" that the human can use to calibrate how much they
    depend on or trust the advice. In this paper, we present an initial exploration
    that suggests showing AI models as more confident than they actually are, even
    when the original AI is well-calibrated, can improve human-AI performance
    (measured as the accuracy and confidence of the human's final prediction after
    seeing the AI advice). We first train a model to predict human incorporation of
    AI advice using data from thousands of human-AI interactions. This enables us
    to explicitly estimate how to transform the AI's prediction confidence, making
    the AI uncalibrated, in order to improve the final human prediction. We
    empirically validate our results across four different tasks--dealing with
    images, text and tabular data--involving hundreds of human participants. We
    further support our findings with simulation analysis. Our findings suggest the
    importance of jointly optimizing the human-AI system as opposed to the standard
    paradigm of optimizing the AI model alone.
    
    9. Knowing About Knowing: An Illusion of Human Competence Can Hinder
      Appropriate Reliance on AI Systems
    Abstract: The dazzling promises of AI systems to augment humans in various tasks hinge
    on whether humans can appropriately rely on them. Recent research has shown
    that appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team
    performance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an
    under-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people
    can hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive
    bias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and
    performance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of
    DKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be
    mitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI
    advice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user
    understanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their
    performance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal
    team performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either
    improving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate
    reliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users
    calibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among
    participants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can
    potentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated
    self-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to
    tackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI
    systems. Our findings advance the current understanding of the role of
    self-assessment in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI decision making. This
    lays out promising future directions for relevant HCI research in this
    community.
    
    10. A Turing Test for Transparency
    Abstract: A central goal of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the
    trust relationship in human-AI interaction. One assumption underlying research
    in transparent AI systems is that explanations help to better assess
    predictions of machine learning (ML) models, for instance by enabling humans to
    identify wrong predictions more efficiently. Recent empirical evidence however
    shows that explanations can have the opposite effect: When presenting
    explanations of ML predictions humans often tend to trust ML predictions even
    when these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests that this effect can be
    attributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation appears. This
    effect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible usage of
    transparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish
    machine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative
    metric for XAI methods based on Turing's imitation game, a Turing Test for
    Transparency. A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was
    generated by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can
    not be detected by humans above chance performance in this binary
    classification task are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a
    requirement for assessing and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI
    interaction. We present experimental results on a crowd-sourced text
    classification task demonstrating that even for basic ML models and XAI
    approaches most participants were not able to differentiate human from machine
    generated explanations. We discuss ethical and practical implications of our
    results for applications of transparent ML.

    Based on the sequence of tasks performed, I propose the following recipe:
    
    **Recipe Name:** Analyzing and Visualizing Application Domains in Arxiv Papers
    
    **Steps:**
    
    1. Collect relevant papers from arxiv using a search query.
    2. Analyze the abstracts of the collected papers to identify application domains.
    3. Count the number of papers in each application domain.
    4. Generate a bar chart of the application domains and the number of papers in each domain.
    5. Save the bar chart as an image file.
    
    Here are the well-documented, generalized Python functions to perform the coding steps in the future:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    import feedparser
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.savefig(output_file)
        plt.show()
    ```
    
    **Usage:**
    
    1. Use the `search_arxiv` function to collect relevant papers from arxiv using a search query.
    2. Analyze the abstracts of the collected papers using your language skills to identify application domains and count the number of papers in each domain.
    3. Use the `generate_bar_chart` function to generate a bar chart of the application domains and the number of papers in each domain, and save it as an image file.
    
    In the docstrings of the functions, I have clarified that non-coding steps, such as analyzing the abstracts of the collected papers, are needed to use the language skill of the assistant.
