# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Solving Tasks Requiring Web Info

AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.
Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to perform tasks which require acquiring info from the web:
* discuss a paper based on its URL.
* discuss about the stock market.

Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to "TERMINATE", the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`, and prompt the user for feedback when the task is finished. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`.

## Requirements

AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install pyautogen and docker:
```bash
pip install pyautogen docker
```


```python
# %pip install pyautogen~=0.2.0b4 docker
```

## Set your API Endpoint

The [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json) function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or a json file.



```python
import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt4", "gpt-4-32k", "gpt-4-32k-0314", "gpt-4-32k-v0314"],
    },
)

llm_config={
    "timeout": 600,
    "cache_seed": 42,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "temperature": 0,
}
```

It first looks for environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" which needs to be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for a json file named "OAI_CONFIG_LIST". It filters the configs by models (you can filter by other keys as well). Only the models with matching names are kept in the list based on the filter condition.

The config list looks like the following:
```python
config_list = [
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4-32k',
        'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt4',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2023-08-01-preview',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4-32k-0314',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2023-08-01-preview',
    },
]
```

You can set the value of config_list in any way you prefer. Please refer to this [notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/oai_openai_utils.ipynb) for full code examples of the different methods.

## Construct Agents

We construct the assistant agent and the user proxy agent. We specify `human_input_mode` as "TERMINATE" in the user proxy agent, which will ask for human feedback when it receives a "TERMINATE" signal from the assistant agent.


```python
# create an AssistantAgent instance named "assistant"
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
# create a UserProxyAgent instance named "user_proxy"
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="TERMINATE",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={"work_dir": "web"},
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message="""Reply TERMINATE if the task has been solved at full satisfaction.
Otherwise, reply CONTINUE, or the reason why the task is not solved yet."""
)
```

## Example Task: Paper Talk from URL

We invoke the `initiate_chat()` method of the user proxy agent to start the conversation. When you run the cell below, you will be prompted to provide feedback after the assistant agent sends a "TERMINATE" signal at the end of the message. If you don't provide any feedback (by pressing Enter directly), the conversation will finish. Before the "TERMINATE" signal, the user proxy agent will try to execute the code suggested by the assistant agent on behalf of the user.


```python
# the assistant receives a message from the user, which contains the task description
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="""
Who should read this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155

)
```

    [33muser_proxy[0m (to assistant):

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33massistant[0m (to user_proxy):
    
    To determine who should read the paper, we need to first understand the content and context of the paper. We can do this by fetching the abstract of the paper from the provided URL and analyzing it. 
    
    Here is a Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the abstract of the paper from the webpage. 
    
    ```python
    # Python script to scrape the abstract of the paper
    
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    
    def get_abstract(url):
        response = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        abstract = soup.find('blockquote', attrs={'class': 'abstract mathjax'}).text.strip()
        return abstract
    
    url = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337"
    abstract = get_abstract(url)
    print(abstract)
    ```
    
    Please run this script and provide the output. Based on the abstract, I can suggest who might be interested in reading this paper.

    Abstract:  Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to address mathematical problems is an
    intriguing research endeavor, considering the abundance of math problems
    expressed in natural language across numerous science and engineering fields.
    While several prior works have investigated solving elementary mathematics
    using LLMs, this work explores the frontier of using GPT-4 for solving more
    complex and challenging math problems. We evaluate various ways of using GPT-4.
    Some of them are adapted from existing work, and one is MathChat, a
    conversational problem-solving framework newly proposed in this work. We
    perform the evaluation on difficult high school competition problems from the
    MATH dataset, which shows the advantage of the proposed conversational
    approach.

## Example Task: Chat about Stock Market


```python

)
```

    [33muser_proxy[0m (to assistant):

    [33massistant[0m (to user_proxy):
    
    To get the YTD gain of the 10 largest technology companies, we need to do the following:
    
    1. Identify the 10 largest technology companies. We can use the list of the largest technology companies by market capitalization. This list can change frequently, so we need to get the latest data. We can use web scraping to get this data from a reliable source.
    
    2. Get the YTD gain for each of these companies. We can use a financial data API to get this data. Yahoo Finance is a popular source for this kind of data.
    
    Here is a Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the yfinance library to get data from Yahoo Finance. This script will print the 10 largest technology companies and their YTD gains.
    
    ```python
    # filename: ytd_gain.py
    
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import yfinance as yf
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Get the list of largest tech companies by market cap
    url = "https://companiesmarketcap.com/technology/largest-technology-companies-by-market-cap/"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Find the table with the data
    table = soup.find('table')
    
    # Get the ticker symbols of the 10 largest companies
    tickers = []
    for row in table.find_all('tr')[1:11]:  # Skip the header row
        ticker = row.find_all('td')[1].text
        tickers.append(ticker)
    
    # Get the YTD gain for each company
    ytd_gains = {}
    for ticker in tickers:
        ticker_data = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        hist = ticker_data.history(period="ytd")
        start_price = hist.iloc[0]['Close']
        end_price = hist.iloc[-1]['Close']
        ytd_gain = (end_price - start_price) / start_price * 100
        ytd_gains[ticker] = ytd_gain
    
    # Print the results
    for ticker, ytd_gain in ytd_gains.items():
        print(f"{ticker}: {ytd_gain:.2f}%")
    ```
    
    To run this script, save it to a file named `ytd_gain.py`, then run it with the command `python ytd_gain.py`.
    
    Please note that this script requires the BeautifulSoup, requests, yfinance, and pandas libraries. If you don't have these libraries installed, you can install them with the command `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests yfinance pandas`.

    I apologize for the error. It seems that the script failed to find the table in the webpage. This could be due to changes in the webpage structure or because the page uses JavaScript to load the table, which BeautifulSoup can't handle.
    
    Let's try a different approach. We'll use the yfinance library to get the data for the 10 largest technology companies. These are currently: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Paypal (PYPL), Adobe (ADBE), and Netflix (NFLX).
    
    Here's the updated Python script:
    
    ```python
    # filename: ytd_gain.py
    
    import yfinance as yf
    
    # List of the 10 largest tech companies by market cap
    tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'PYPL', 'ADBE', 'NFLX']
    
    # Get the YTD gain for each company
    ytd_gains = {}
    for ticker in tickers:
        ticker_data = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        hist = ticker_data.history(period="ytd")
        start_price = hist.iloc[0]['Close']
        end_price = hist.iloc[-1]['Close']
        ytd_gain = (end_price - start_price) / start_price * 100
        ytd_gains[ticker] = ytd_gain
    
    # Print the results
    for ticker, ytd_gain in ytd_gains.items():
        print(f"{ticker}: {ytd_gain:.2f}%")
    ```
    
    To run this script, save it to a file named `ytd_gain.py`, then run it with the command `python ytd_gain.py`.
