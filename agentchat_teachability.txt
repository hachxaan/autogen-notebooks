# Chatting with TeachableAgent

Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can even demonstrate in-context learning of things that the user teaches the assistant during the chat. But these memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats, the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.

`TeachableAgent` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory (a vector database). Memory is saved to disk at the end of each chat, then loaded from disk at the start of the next. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it remember them in later chats.

In making decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `TeachableAgent` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` to analyze pieces of text in several different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for a response.

This notebook demonstrates how `TeachableAgent` can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. To chat with `TeachableAgent` yourself, run [chat_with_teachable_agent.py](../test/agentchat/chat_with_teachable_agent.py).

## Requirements

AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install the [teachable] option.
```bash
pip install "pyautogen[teachable]"
```


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
# %pip install "pyautogen[teachable]
```

## Set your API Endpoint

The [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json) function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or a json file.


```python
import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    file_location=".",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4", "gpt4", "gpt-4-32k"],
    },
)

print(config_list[0]["model"])
```

    gpt-4


It first looks for environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" which needs to be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for a json file named "OAI_CONFIG_LIST". It filters the configs by models (you can filter by other keys as well). After application of this particular filter, only the gpt-4 models are kept.

The config list looks like the following:
```python
config_list = [
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2023-06-01-preview',
    },
    {
        'model': 'gpt-4-32k',
        'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
        'base_url': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
        'api_type': 'azure',
        'api_version': '2023-06-01-preview',
    },
]
```

If you open this notebook in colab, you can upload your files by clicking the file icon on the left panel and then choose "upload file" icon.

You can set the value of config_list in other ways if you prefer, e.g., loading from a YAML file.

## Construct Agents
For this walkthrough, we start by resetting the teachable agent's memory store. This deletes any memories from prior conversations that may be stored on disk.


```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.teachable_agent import TeachableAgent
from autogen import UserProxyAgent

llm_config = {
    "timeout": 60,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "use_cache": True,  # Use False to explore LLM non-determinism.
}

teach_config={
    "verbosity": 0,  # 0 for basic info, 1 to add memory operations, 2 for analyzer messages, 3 for memo lists.
    "reset_db": True,  # Set to True to start over with an empty database.
    "path_to_db_dir": "./tmp/notebook/teachable_agent_db",  # Path to the directory where the database will be stored.
    "recall_threshold": 1.5,  # Higher numbers allow more (but less relevant) memos to be recalled.
}

try:
    from termcolor import colored
except ImportError:
    def colored(x, *args, **kwargs):
        return x
    
teachable_agent = TeachableAgent(
    name="teachableagent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    teach_config=teach_config)

user = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: True if "TERMINATE" in x.get("content") else False,
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=0,
)

## Learning new facts
Let's teach the agent some facts it doesn't already know, since they are more recent than GPT-4's training data.


```python
text = "What is the Vicuna model?"
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message=text, clear_history=True)
```

    [33muser[0m (to teachableagent):
    
    What is the Vicuna model?
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mteachableagent[0m (to user):
    
    I'm sorry, but I don't have information about the "Vicuna model" in my current database. Could you please provide some context, description, or details about this model so I can better assist you?
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



```python
text = "Vicuna is a 13B-parameter language model released by Meta."
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message=text, clear_history=False)
```

    [33muser[0m (to teachableagent):
    
    Vicuna is a 13B-parameter language model released by Meta.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mteachableagent[0m (to user):
    
    Thank you for providing the information. The Vicuna model is a large-scale language model developed by Meta. It consists of 13 billion parameters, which is what makes it able to understand and generate human-like text across various topics. Parameters in a neural network are the weights and biases assigned to each connection between the neurons, and having more parameters enables the model to learn and capture more complex patterns and relationships in data. As an AI language model, Vicuna can be utilized in various language-related tasks, such as text completion, translation, summarization, and more.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



```python
text = "What is the Orca model?"
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message=text, clear_history=False)
```

    [33muser[0m (to teachableagent):
    
    What is the Orca model?
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mteachableagent[0m (to user):
    
    The Orca model is a yet-to-be-released language model by Meta, referring to the Research Preview API release of Meta's advanced language model. While I don't have specific details about the Orca model at this time, it is expected that the model would have an even larger number of parameters to further enhance its capabilities compared to its predecessor, Vicuna.
    
    As AI language models evolve, they generally become more efficient at understanding and generating human-like text. This makes them more effective in completing a wide range of tasks, including text completion, translation, summarization, and Q&A, as well as providing more accurate and coherent results in various applications.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



```python
text = "Orca is a 13B-parameter language model released by Microsoft. It outperforms Vicuna on most tasks."
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message=text, clear_history=False)
```

    [33muser[0m (to teachableagent):
    
    Orca is a 13B-parameter language model released by Microsoft. It outperforms Vicuna on most tasks.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mteachableagent[0m (to user):
    
    Thank you for the clarification. Orca is a 13-billion-parameter language model developed by Microsoft. It is designed to outperform Vicuna, the language model released by Meta. With a large number of parameters, Orca is capable of understanding and generating human-like text across diverse subjects, making it highly useful in various applications.
    
    Orca's advanced capabilities allow it to excel in tasks such as text completion, translation, summarization, Q&A, and more. Its performance improvement over Vicuna highlights the rapid advancements in natural language processing (NLP) research and the development of increasingly capable AI language models.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's end our first chat here. The following function needs to be called at the end of each chat, so that `TeachableAgent` can store what the user has taught it.


```python
teachable_agent.learn_from_user_feedback()
```

    REVIEWING CHAT FOR USER TEACHINGS TO REMEMBER[0m


Now let's start a new chat by clearing the previous chat's history. At this point, common LLM-based assistants would forget everything from the last chat. But `TeachableAgent` can retrieve memories from its vector DB as needed, allowing it to recall and reason over facts that the user taught it in earlier conversations.


```python
text = "How does the Vicuna model compare to the Orca model?"
user.initiate_chat(teachable_agent, message=text, clear_history=True)
```

    [33muser[0m (to teachableagent):
    
    How does the Vicuna model compare to the Orca model?
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [33mteachableagent[0m (to user):
    
    The Vicuna and Orca models are both 13B-parameter language models released by Meta and Microsoft, respectively. In terms of performance, Orca has been reported to outperform Vicuna on most tasks. However, without detailed information about specific tasks and benchmarks, it is difficult to provide a more comprehensive comparison. Generally speaking, both models are advanced language models that aim to provide high-quality natural language understanding and generation, but Orca appears to have an edge in terms of overall performance.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Learning user preferences
Now let's teach the agent some of our preferences. Suppose that we frequently post short summaries of new papers for our team to read, and we want the teachable agent to help us do this faster.

Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4

Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions."""

## Learning new skills
Finally, let's extend the teachable agent's capabilities by teaching it a new skill for accomplishing a challenging type of task. 

The [Sparks of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) paper evaluated GPT-4 on math problems like the following, which it could only solve 32% of the time.


```python

    -Let's think step-by-step, write down a plan, and then write down your solution as: "The solution is: A * B + C * D".

    [33mteachableagent[0m (to user):
    
    Step 1: Identify the current equation and the target value on the right-hand side.
    Current equation: 9 * 4 + 6 * 6 = 72
    Target value: 99
    
    Step 2: Determine what numbers can be changed on the left-hand side.
    Possible changes: 9, 4, 6 (first occurrence), and 6 (second occurrence)
    
    Step 3: Evaluate whether each change in the numbers on the left-hand side can result in the target value.
    9 -> If changed, it would create a larger product.
    4 -> If changed, the product would increase or decrease by more than the amount needed to reach 99.
    6 (first occurrence) -> If increased to 7, then the equation would be 9 * 4 + 7 * 6 = 94, which is still not 99.
    6 (second occurrence) -> If increased to 7, then the equation would be 9 * 4 + 6 * 7 = 99.
    
    Step 4: Write down the solution.
    The solution is: 9 * 4 + 6 * 7
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This time, lets teach the agent a reliable strategy for solving such tasks.

2. Let F denote the final number on the right.
3. Calculate the difference between the two, G = F - E.
4. Examine the numbers on the left one by one until finding one that divides evenly into G, where negative integers are allowed.
5. Calculate J = G / H. This is the number of times that H divides into G.
6. Verify that J is an integer, and that H * J = G.
7. Find the number on the left which is multiplied by H, and call it K.

    Let's follow the advice to modify one integer on the left hand side of the equation to make the right hand side become 99:
    
    1. Let E denote the original number on the right: E = 72.
    2. Let F denote the final number on the right: F = 99.
    3. Calculate the difference between the two, G = F - E: G = 99 - 72 = 27.
    4. Examine the numbers on the left one by one to find one that divides evenly into G: 9, 4, 6. Since 9 divides 27 evenly, we will work with 9 (H = 9).
    5. Calculate J = G / H: J = 27 / 9 = 3.
    6. Verify that J is an integer, and that H * J = G: J is an integer, and 9 * 3 = 27.
    7. Find the number on the left which is multiplied by H (9), and call it K: K = 4.
    8. Change K to K + J: K_new = 4 + 3 = 7.
    9. Recompute the value on the left, and verify that it equals F: (9 * 7) + (6 * 6) = 63 + 36 = 99.
    
    The solution is: 9 * 7 + 6 * 6

    2. Let F denote the final number on the right: F = 59.
    3. Calculate the difference between the two, G = F - E: G = 59 - 87 = -28.
    4. Examine the numbers on the left one by one to find one that divides evenly into G: 8, 3, 7, 9. Since 7 divides -28 evenly, we will work with 7 (H = 7).
    5. Calculate J = G / H: J = -28 / 7 = -4.
    6. Verify that J is an integer, and that H * J = G: J is an integer, and 7 * (-4) = -28.
    7. Find the number on the left which is multiplied by H (7), and call it K: K = 9.
    8. Change K to K + J: K_new = 9 + (-4) = 5.
    9. Recompute the value on the left, and verify that it equals F: (8 * 3) + (7 * 5) = 24 + 35 = 59.
    
    The solution is: 8 * 3 + 7 * 5
